# scheme-hs
Scheme interpreter in Haskell

Does not implement many features of Scheme, such as hygienic macros (macros are not hygienic), lexical scoping (scoping is done at runtime), and variable references (everything is passed by value).

Otherwise, it is more or less a rather lenient implementation of R5RS (and some parts of R6RS).
